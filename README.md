# 100 days of code

This repo documents my progress through Angela Yu's 100 days of code Python MOOC (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). It will hopefully help me stay accountable :)

## Cool projects:

Day 46: [Spotify Time Machine](https://github.com/ffrodslaw/100-days-of-code/tree/main/46_spotify-time-machine) - automatically creates a Spotify playlist of a date's most popular songs
